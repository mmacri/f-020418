            <h2>What Is Affiliate Marketing?</h2>
            <p>
              Affiliate marketing is a way for websites like ours to earn money by promoting products from other companies. When you click on one of our affiliate links and purchase a product, we receive a small commission from the retailer at no additional cost to you.
            </p>

              <li><strong>Your Needs First:</strong> Our primary goal is to help you find the best products for your specific needs, not to maximize our commissions.</li>
